This is a basic Todo List API with spring webflux to demonstrate using reactive hibernate in a spring context.
It is more suited for vert.x and Quarkus environments, as it depends heavily on smallrye project dependencies and vert.x
reactive db drivers, but, you know, it's worth a shot
It also uses Spring Native because it is vastly superior compared to running on the JVM

Ignore the (lack of) error handling and logging.
Application starts on port 8080 as usual.
